    <h3>"And all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves..." </br>
      Virginia Woolf</br>
      COUNTRY LIVING</h3>

<p>Living in Canada has made helped me understand the beauty of nature. Parks and wide open spaces are everywhere. I come Japan where there are many mountains, forests and trees, but the feeling is quite different. Nature is compact. It is clustered in tight areas. The mountains are bunched together and forests just stop. In Canada, nature seems to go on forever. There are large areas of green and yellow. It is expansive and beautiful. Mother nature has so many faces. </br></br>

  <strong>Nature’s importance to our health</strong></br>
  Nature performs major miracles for us every day – from giving us great views and helping to prevent disasters to creating the weather and keeping us supplied with clean water, fresh air and bountiful food.</br></br>
  
  When using water or doing the shopping it’s easy to forget that without healthy soil and diverse plant and animal species doing their thing our lives would be tougher and poorer. Trees in towns cool us in summer and trap air pollution. Bees pollinate our crops, putting food on our table and in our stomachs. However smart we’ve become as a species, without diverse nature and a healthy functioning natural environment we’ll be as lost as a tourist without a map app.</p>
