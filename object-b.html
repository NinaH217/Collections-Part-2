    <h2>Gallery 2: Flowers</h2>

    <h3>“Many eyes go through the meadow, but few see the flowers in it.”</br>
      Ralph Waldo Emerson</h3>

<p>Flowers give me energy. They bring me up when I’m down and brighten any room. My mother and grandmother lover flowers and when I was little, my grandmother watered the flowers around the house every morning as if to greet them as they were waking up. She had over twenty different flowers. </br></br>

  In many weddings, the bride carries a bouquet of flowers when she walks down the aisle. Thus, it is very symbolic in that sense. On special occasions of valentines and anniversary, we gift our partners’ beautiful flowers as a symbol of our love. Similarly, we send flowers for someone who is sick to brighten their day. We also send flowers as a token of condolence during funerals. Thus, we see they have so many uses in so many areas. My favorite is tulip. I like other flowers too but I find the tulip to be the most beautiful among all flowers. They come in many colours so it offers great variety.
